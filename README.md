Hello, welcome to my Weather app. I wanted to make a project that was easy and utilizing an API. So I decided to create a weather app to show off in React.

I am still new with frontend stuff and have been teaching myself as I go along. Right now I am focusing more on JavaScript, then I plan to move to TypeScript. 

I am also teaching myself HTML and CSS as well to become a better frontend developer.
